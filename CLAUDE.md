# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

This is **not an application** — it's a packager and distributor of *skills* for AI
coding agents (Claude Code, Codex). A "skill" is a self-contained folder under
`skills/<name>/` whose `SKILL.md` holds agent instructions, optionally alongside
runnable `scripts/`, `references/`, `templates/`, and `assets/`. The repo ships two
ways to consume them: as **Claude Code plugins** (`plugins/`, advertised by
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and via a **Node installer** (`bin/hfa.js` → `src/`)
that copies skills into a target runtime.

The skills themselves are the product; `src/` is just plumbing that catalogs, resolves,
and installs them. End-user docs (install paths, skill list, API keys) live in
`README.md` and are not repeated here.

## Commands

```bash
npm run validate         # lint skills + plugin manifests against the contract (src/registry + scripts/validate.js)
npm run build:registry   # regenerate registry.json from skill frontmatter
npm run check:registry   # CI check: fail if registry.json is stale (does not write)

node bin/hfa.js list                                              # browse skills + personas
node bin/hfa.js install <skill|persona> --platform claude-code   # copy a skill + its deps into a runtime
node bin/hfa.js install <skill> --platform codex --scope project --dry-run
node bin/hfa.js doctor --platform claude-code                    # check runtimes + API keys
```

`npm run validate` + `npm run check:registry` are exactly what CI runs
(`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) on every push/PR. There is no build step and no
JS test suite — individual skills may ship their own tests (e.g. `skills/finmind/tests/`
runs under `pytest`), run inside the skill folder.

Note: the npm name `hfa` is taken, so the binary is **not** publishable as `npx hfa` —
always invoke it as `node bin/hfa.js`.

## Architecture

**Skill frontmatter is the single source of truth.** The YAML block at the top of each
`SKILL.md` drives everything downstream — `registry.json`, the installer's dependency
resolution, and the validator. Never hand-edit `registry.json`; edit frontmatter and run
`npm run build:registry`.

### The pipeline (`src/`)

- `frontmatter.js` — a **minimal, purpose-built** YAML parser, *not* a general one. It
  handles only the shapes the skill contract allows (scalar/block `description`, inline
  or block `requires`/`env` lists). Frontmatter that strays outside those shapes will
  silently misparse — keep it within the contract.
- `registry.js` — `scanSkills()` walks `skills/`, parses frontmatter, and infers
  `runtime` from disk (`package.json` → `bun`; a `scripts/*.py` → `python`; else `none`).
  `getSkills()` scans **live disk first** and only falls back to `registry.json` if the
  tree is unavailable, so the CLI always reflects reality even when the committed
  registry lags.
- `resolve.js` — `resolveClosure()` walks the `requires` graph depth-first
  (dependencies-first, cycle-detecting). Personas are read from the **plugin manifests**
  (`plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), not from a separate config — those manifests
  are the source of truth for what a persona bundles.
- `install.js` + `adapters/` — `install()` resolves the closure, then each platform
  adapter (`claude-code.js`, `codex.js`) decides install dir, env-file location, and
  `write()` behavior. `copy.js#copyTree` does the recursive copy, skipping
  `node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `tests`. Codex has no native skill
  format, so its adapter additionally emits a slash-prompt under `prompts/`.
- `env.js` — unions the `env:` keys across a closure, resolves them from
  `process.env` + an `.env` file, prompts interactively for the rest, and persists with
  `chmod 600`. Any `env:` key a skill declares **must** also appear in `.env.example`
  (the validator enforces this).
- `paths.js` — repo-root-relative paths and `EXCLUDED_SKILLS` (skills present on disk but
  withheld from the shippable registry/plugins, e.g. an in-progress skill with an empty
  body — reported as "skipped", not a failure).

### Skill contract (enforced by `scripts/validate.js`)

- `name` must equal the folder name and be kebab-case.
- `type` is `capability` (one atomic job, **no `requires`**) or `composite` (a workflow
  that orchestrates capabilities via `requires:`). Composites may only require
  capabilities, never other composites.
- `description` ≥ 40 chars and **must contain a `Triggers:` clause** of natural-language
  phrases — agents only see `name` + `description`, so discoverability lives there.
- `SKILL.md` body must be non-empty; no dependency cycles; no **dependency-manager**
  dirs tracked by git (`node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__` — this is what
  `validate.js` enforces). Deliberately-vendored *first-party runtime assets* a skill
  must ship to function (e.g. `skills/charting/vendor/highcharts/`, inlined for offline
  PDF-safe rendering) are allowed and **should** be committed — they are not "vendored
  dirs" in the dependency sense and `copyTree` ships them on install.
- Plugin manifests must reference existing skills **and include each referenced skill's
  full dependency closure** (a composite without its capabilities fails validation).

## Making changes

- **Editing a skill's frontmatter or adding/removing a skill** → run
  `npm run build:registry`, then `npm run validate`. Add the skill to the relevant
  `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (with its dependencies) if it should ship in a
  persona.
- **Promoting a work-in-progress skill** → remove it from `EXCLUDED_SKILLS` in
  `src/paths.js` and rebuild the registry (this is what the current uncommitted diff does
  for `charting`).
- **Adding a new API key** → declare it in `.env.example` *and* in the consuming skill's
  `env:` list, or validation fails.
- **Adding a platform** → add an adapter in `src/adapters/` and register it in
  `adapters/index.js`; the adapter interface is `installDir(scope)`, `envFile(scope)`,
  `write(skill, scope)`.


## Git commit rules
- Use Conventional Commits: type(scope): subject (imperative, ≤50 chars).
- One logical change per commit; it must build and pass tests alone.
- Body explains WHY. Reference issues in footer (Fixes #123).
- Separate refactors from behavior changes into distinct commits.
- Stage files explicitly; never `git add -A`. Never commit secrets.
- Commit at completed checkpoints, not partial/broken states.
