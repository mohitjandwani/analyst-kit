  Shared runtime for Hedge Fund Analyst skills: the ~/.hfa data home, config store,
  local usage analytics with opt-in telemetry, daily update checks, and a per-user
  learnings log every skill reads and appends to. Loaded automatically as a dependency
  of every other skill. Triggers: "hfa setup", "hfa config", "check for hfa updates",
  "upgrade hfa skills", "show my hfa learnings", "turn hfa telemetry on/off", "show my
  hfa usage".

# HFA Core — shared runtime

Every HFA skill depends on this one. Skills run the **Preamble** block at start and the
**Completion** block at end (both injected by `scripts/sync-preamble.js` in the source
repo); this file documents the machinery behind those blocks, and is what you should
read when the user explicitly asks about HFA setup, config, telemetry, updates, usage,
or learnings.

## The `~/.hfa/` data home

Fixed per-user location for everything HFA persists (override with `$HFA_HOME`):

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config` | `key=value` settings (`hfa-config get/set/list`) |
| `.env` | API keys (`FMP_API_KEY=...`), `chmod 600`, shared across projects |
| `device-id` | stable anonymous id, created only for `community` telemetry |
| `analytics/skill-usage.jsonl` | local usage log: start/end events with outcome + duration |
| `analytics/.pending-*` | open-session markers; stale ones finalize as `CRASH` |
| `sessions/` | per-agent-session dedupe markers (one prompt round per session) |
| `learnings.jsonl` | per-user learnings log (patterns / pitfalls / preferences) |
| `last-update-check`, `update-snoozed` | update-check cache (1 day) and snooze (7 days) |
| `.onboarded`, `.telemetry-prompted`, `.env-prompted-<KEY>` | once-ever prompt markers |
| `core-path` | cached location of this skill on disk |
| `install-manifest.jsonl` | what `hfa install` installed (drives guided upgrades) |

## Scripts (`bin/`)

- `hfa-config get <key> | set <key> <value> | list` — config store. Defaults:
  `telemetry=off`, `update_check=true`. Optional: `posthog_key`, `posthog_host`.
- `hfa-preamble --skill <name> [--env K1,K2]` — echoes `DEDUP`, `HFA_VERSION`,
  `TELEMETRY`, `TEL_PROMPTED`, `ONBOARDED`, `MISSING_KEYS` (+ per-key
  `KEY_PROMPTED_*`), `UPGRADE`, `LEARNINGS`, then logs the start event.
- `hfa-log start|end --skill <name> [--outcome <O>]` — appends local JSONL events and,
  when telemetry is on, fires the remote event in the background.
- `hfa-update-check [--force | --snooze <version>]` — prints
  `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <local> <remote>` or nothing. Max one network fetch per day,
  `curl --max-time 3`.
- `hfa-learn add '<one-line-json>' | recent [--skill S] [--topic T] [--limit N]` —
  learnings log.

All scripts are defensive: they never exit non-zero from the skill's point of view,
never block on the network, and a total failure of this runtime must never stop a
skill from doing its actual job.

## Telemetry tiers

Local `analytics/skill-usage.jsonl` is always written — it is the user's own machine
and powers crash detection and usage review. Only the **remote** leg (PostHog) is
consent-gated by `hfa-config get telemetry`:

- `off` (default) — nothing leaves the machine.
- `anonymous` — `{skill, version, outcome, duration_s, platform}` with no identifier.
- `community` — same, plus a stable random `device-id` so usage counts deduplicate.

Remote events **never** include repo names, file paths, tickers, file content, or API
keys. The local log records a sanitized repo slug for the user's own reference; it is
never uploaded. Opt out any time: `hfa-config set telemetry off`.

## Completion statuses

Every skill ends its Completion block with one outcome:
`DONE` | `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | `ERROR` | `ABORT` | `NEEDS_CONTEXT`.
Report the same status to the user honestly — `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` lists the concerns.

## Learnings protocol

Log with `hfa-learn add` **only** durable discoveries that would save 5+ minutes in a
future session: a data-source quirk, a per-user preference, a pitfall that produced a
wrong number. Types: `pattern` (reusable approach), `pitfall` (what not to do),
`preference` (user stated). Include `"ticker"` or `"topic"` when the learning is
scoped, `"confidence"` 1–10 (user-stated preference = 10; verified observation = 8–9;
inference = 4–5), and an ISO-8601 `"ts"`. Never log obvious facts, one-time transient
errors, or anything secret. The preamble surfaces recent relevant entries — treat them
as ground truth about this user unless contradicted in-session.

## Upgrades

The preamble surfaces `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>` at most once per day, snoozed
7 days on decline. The guided flow lives in `references/upgrade.md` (plugin channel →
`/plugin` marketplace update; installer channel → fetch GitHub tarball, re-run
`node bin/hfa.js install` for everything in `install-manifest.jsonl`).
